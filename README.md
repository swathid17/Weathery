# Weather App

This project was developed as part of the **Web Development Internship** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.  
The goal of **Task 05** is to create a dynamic **Weather App** that fetches and displays real-time weather data using a weather API.

Task Description:

The Weather App enables users to:

- Search weather information by city name
- View current weather conditions such as:
  - Temperature
  - Weather status (clear, cloudy, rain, etc.)
  - City and country
  - Weather icon
- Get relevant information with a clean and responsive interface


 Technologies Used:

- **HTML** – For the structure of the web page  
- **CSS** – For styling and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** – For API integration and interactivity  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – For fetching real-time weather data


 Features:

- Live weather data based on user input
- Display of temperature, weather condition, and location
- Responsive and clean UI
- Error handling for invalid city inputs



What I Learned:

- How to integrate third-party APIs (OpenWeatherMap)
- Handling asynchronous requests using `fetch()`
- Updating DOM dynamically with JavaScript
- Improving user experience with form validation and clean design



How to Run the Project:

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser  
3. Enter a city name and click the search button to get weather updates
